GoLang has different packages which contain different pre-saved functions to use in our code files.
So, here we list down what we've learnt/came accross so far.

1. fmt => contains functions like, 
	  1. Print - 
	  2. Println
	  3. Printf

2. time => 1. Now() {can also be used with UnixNano() which gives time from January 1, 1970 UTC till now in nanosecond accuracy.

3. math/rand => 1. Intn() = generates random integers to the max limit given as paramerter (the number written in parantheses)
		2. Seed() = gives the random number generator func a value according to which the numbers are randomized.
